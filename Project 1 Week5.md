# Project 1 Week5

The purpose of this project is to reproduce the Figure1, that is from the Hastie book, and implement the Support Vector Machine algorithm from scratch.

> Figure 1: Hastie, et al. Elements of Statistical Learning, Figure 12.2

Figure 2 shows the work I reproduced. The first left sub-figure of Figure2 is generated by the sklearn `package`, and the second one is generated by the SVM code wrote from scratch.

The two figures are almost same, except the test error part. The train error of second figure is 0.267 which is also similar to the results on the Figure1. I will finish the test error before the end of this project.



In this project, I use python language to reproduce the figures. In addition, the numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn packages are applied in this project. The requirement.txt files also list all possible package need to install beforehand. I implement the simple SMO method to solve SVM problem from scratch. Since when the penalty value goes up, the algorithm takes more time to converge. In this case, the figure sub-figure I use sklearn package to generate the figure; yet, the second sub-figure has based the code I wrote. 

When I was reproducing the figure, it is much easier if I could use the package directly to get the answer. However, I also implement the SMO algorithm. The principle of this method is not easy to understand. It takes quite a long time to debug every time since the runtime of the code I wrote is much slower than the same algorithm inside the package. In future work, I could find some ways to improve the efficiency of this program.
